<h1>Don't Click the Bombs</h1>
<p>You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. <br> If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.<br></p>
<p>Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.</p>
<p>To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click</p>
